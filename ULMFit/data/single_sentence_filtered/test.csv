5,"By consensus, obstetricians could arrange delivery in the latter group from 40+0 weeks’ gestation."
0,"In the two groups receiving immunosuppressive treatment in addition to supportive therapy, baseline data were recorded when the new treatment began."
16,Logistic regression was used to assess the effect of treatment group on the primary outcome while controlling for baseline group differences and to test for interactions between variables.
7,"We did not plan to collect data for cause of death in the original trial protocol; however, after early termination of the trial because of the increased 28-day mortality in the salbutamol group, the data for the main cause of death were ascertained for all participants dying within 28 days of randomisation."
5,Subjects were randomly assigned to memantine or placebo.
6,Planned secondary outcomes were growth and anaemia at age 1 year.
12,"We made it very simple to execute randomisation and delivery because the health professional took the next pack off the shelf that contained pre-randomised advice sheets (that is, there was no requirement—and hence no error—in finding and using the correct advice sheets)."
6,"Samples were analyzed by LabCorp, a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–certified laboratory."
6,The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of OKZ at different doses and administration frequencies compared with PBO.
5,"All patients received supportive therapy, including renin-angiotensin blockade, statins, and anticoagulants as indicated."
17,An unadjusted analysis is also presented.
0,A non-randomised immediate prescription group was chosen to allow all patients to enter the study and provide two important opportunities.
0,For our per-protocol analysis we included children who in both groups received all doses with an interval between the doses of 60 and 120 days and had not violated the randomisation codes.
0,"Patients to be included received detailed study information, gave written informed consent, and were instructed in completing the study diary (comprising SCCAI and other interview parameters)."
6,"Efficacy criteria were assessed at 8:30 in the morning under ‘off-L-dopa’ conditions, that is, at least 8 h after the withdrawal of dopaminergic medications."
5,"On day 8, patients randomised to receive ponesimod 20 or 40 mg were up-titrated to the 20 mg dose and patients randomised to the 10 mg dose were mock up-titrated."
0,"We monitored the quality and integrity of the accumulating clinical data according to a protocol agreed with the study sponsors, which involved central statistical monitoring according to the principles described by Buyse and colleagues,28 supplemented by onsite monitoring and detailed source data verification in a random sample of 10% of records in centres that had recruited more than 30 patients, or when patterns in the data at a centre seemed anomalous."
